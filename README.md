This script automated the writing of ORCA input files and the extraction from ORCA output files.
A specific focus is on the simulation of simple diatomic molecules to assist in understanding MO theory at an undergraduate level.

Dependancies:

Python 3.8.8 (other versions not tested, but please note I have made liberal use of fstrings!)

This code requires ORCA to be installed and added to PATH to function:
(https://orcaforum.kofo.mpg.de/app.php/portal)
ORCA is freely available for academic and educational use.

It also requires the matplotlib, os and glob libraries.
